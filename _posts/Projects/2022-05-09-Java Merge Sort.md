## Quick Description

This was our first project in Java. Its goal was to help us understand different sorting methods, get familiar with Java and its syntax, learn the fundamentals of OOP, and apply the MVC architectural design. Through this project, we were able to practice writing cleaner code, organizing our classes properly, and understanding how data flows within an application. It also served as a foundation for developing more complex programs in later exercises and projects.

## What does it actually do?

The java application is a simple visual application of merge sort, it uses Swing as its frontent library. The application asks for input then shows how each item in the array are divided, divide and conquer, sorted then reconstructed visually.
