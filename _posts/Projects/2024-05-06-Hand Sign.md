## Quick Description

A simple Duolingo-style hand sign learning app built with Flutter. It gamifies hand sign learning through lessons and tests. Users learn by identifying the correct hand sign from multiple choices, and each lesson includes a test with limited lives. Passing a test unlocks the next lesson.
