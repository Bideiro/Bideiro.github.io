## Quick Description

This project is a simple tutor-finding app that uses Google Firebase as its database. It includes features such as live chat, basic user authentication, and a calendar display with printing functionality. The concept is similar to Grab, where users can select a tutor and communicate with them in real time to schedule an appointment. Due to the limited timeframe, some planned features such as user geolocation and a payment system were not implemented.
