## Introduction 

The poultry shop industry faces complex challenges in managing products, inventory, sales, and daily operations, making an efficient product management system essential. This project focuses on developing an automated product management system for Ranil’s Poultry Shop to streamline key processes such as POS transactions, inventory tracking, supplier and customer management, reporting, and product information management. Because poultry shops handle diverse and sensitive products, even small errors in sales, storage, or tracking can lead to financial losses and product waste. An automated system can improve accuracy, reduce manual workload, predict demand using sales data, prevent stockouts or overstocking, and enhance customer service through faster and more reliable operations. Additionally, computer-based systems offer benefits such as data standardization, reduced paperwork, cost savings, quick data access, and customization to meet business needs. This project also examines the challenges of the current manual system and highlights the importance of implementing a secure, efficient, and adaptable solution that can support long-term growth and improve the overall customer and business experience.
